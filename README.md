## Installation

The only thing you need to do is run ```npm start```

 If that does not work enter ``` export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider ```

Then run ```npm start``` again. 

Also, in a separate terminal you will need to run ```npm run server```



## Usage

The single-page application gives you information about working out, and gives you template workout split. You can also create your own workout or add to the template workout
